               <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
               <p>IN THE AUTUMN OF <span class="date">1951</span> I began thinking of <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##NC">Cody Pomeray</a></span>, thinking of <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##NC">Cody Pomeray</a></span>. We had been great buddies on the road. I was in <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##NY">New York</a></span> and I wanted to go to <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##CA">California</a></span> and see him, but I had no money. I'm in an old El station on Third Avenue and 47th,
                  sitting in wooden sunken-seat benches along the walls—the Porter sign in the door
                  is almost all faded.</p>
               <p>Main thing, <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##NC">Cody</a></span> had given up and was following not me, but anybody sweet and good and kind in the
                  world, like he'd died and came over to see me before his departure, dammit, into eternity.
                  This was a dream last night. And <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##NC">Cody</a></span> let others do talking, for once was a smiling and bemused listener, like <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AG">Irwin</a></span> or everybody—He said something: "I'll only be back for a short time but while I'm
                  here you've got to take care of me, understand?—you've got to see I don't get lonely,
                  I don't know anybody in that cafeteria of yours on Fourth Street and Bowery, I don't
                  ever go to those high balcony movies on V-Square, Brooklyn is too mad, the Els confuse
                  me, the canals, the little white houses, the ships east or west and that pump at the
                  foot of the hill where you peel potatoes I have nothing to do with it—I'm in your
                  hands entirely as you were in Frisco when I jumped back in the car going fullspeed—I
                  want to meet people and girls—take me to the white one, the soft one you had on your
                  couch there—Oh this is a cold dark town, man."</p>
