               <p>ONCE I WAS YOUNG and had so much more orientation and could talk with nervous intelligence
                  about everything and with clarity and without as much literary preambling as this;
                  in other words this is the story of an unself-confident man, at the same time of an
                  egomaniac, naturally, facetious won't do—just to start at the beginning and let the
                  truth seep out, that's what I'll do—. It began on a warm summernight—ah, she was sitting
                  on a fender with <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AR">Julien Alexander</a></span> who is … let me begin with the history of the subterraneans of <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##NY">San Francisco</a></span>…</p>
               <p><span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AR">Julien Alexander</a></span> is the angel of the subterraneans, the subterraneans is a name invented by <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AG">Adam Moorad</a></span> who is a poet and friend of mine who said "They are hip without being slick, they
                  are intelligent without being corny, they are intellectual as hell and know all about
                  Pound without being pretentious or talking too much about it, they are very quiet,
                  they are very Christlike." <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AR">Julien</a></span> certainly is Christlike. I was coming down the street with <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##JN">Larry O'Hara</a></span> old drinking buddy of mine from all the times in <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##NY">San Francisco</a></span> in my long and nervous and mad careers I've gotten drunk and in fact cadged drinks
                  off friends with such "genial" regularity nobody really cared to notice or announce
                  that I am developing or was developing, in my youth, such bad freeloading habits though
                  of course they did notice but liked me and as <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##LC">Sam</a></span> said "Everybody comes to you for your gasoline boy, that's some filling station you
                  got there" or say words to that effect—old <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##JN">Larry O'Hara</a></span> always nice to me, a crazy Irish young businessman of <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##NY">San Francisco</a></span> with Balzacian backroom in his bookstore where they'd smoke tea and talk of the old
                  days of the great Basie band or the days of the great Chu Berry—of whom more anon
                  since she got involved with him too as she had to get involved with everyone because
                  of knowing me who am nervous and many leveled and not in the least one souled—not
                  a piece of my pain has showed yet—or suffering—Angels, bear with me—I'm not even looking
                  at the page but straight ahead into the sadglint of my wallroom and at a Sarah Vaughan
                  Gerry Mulligan Radio KROW show on the desk in the form of a radio, in other words,
                  they were sitting on the fender of a car in front of the Black Mask bar on Montgomery
                  Street, <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AR">Julien Alexander</a></span> the Christlike unshaved thin youthful quiet strange almost as you or as <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AG">Adam</a></span> might say apocalyptic angel or saint of the subterraneans, certainly star (now),
                  and she, <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html##AL">Mardou Fox</a></span>, whose face when first I saw it in Dante's bar around the corner made me think, "By
                  God, I've got to get involved with that little woman".</p>
