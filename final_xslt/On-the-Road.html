               <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
               <p>I first met <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#NC">Dean</a></span> not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that
                  I won't bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably
                  weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead. With the coming of <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#NC">Dean Moriarty</a></span> began the part of my life you could call my life on the road. Before that I'd often
                  dreamed of going West to see the country, always vaguely planning and never taking
                  off. <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#NC">Dean</a></span> is the perfect guy for the road because he actually was born on the road, when his
                  parents were passing through <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##SLC">Salt Lake City</a></span> in <span class="date">1926</span>, in a jalopy, on their way to <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html#LA">Los Angeles</a></span>. First reports of him came to me through <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#HC">Chad King</a></span>, who'd shown me a few letters from him written in a <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html##NM">New Mexico</a></span> whoorm school. I was tremendously interested in the letters because they so naively
                  and sweetly asked <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#HC">Chad</a></span> to teach him all about <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#">Nietzsche</a></span> and all the wonderful intellectual things that <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#HC">Chad</a></span> knew. At one point <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#AG">Carlo</a></span> and I talked about the letters and wondered if we would ever meet the strange <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#NC">Dean Moriarty</a></span>. This is all far back, when <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#NC">Dean</a></span> was not the way he is today, when he was a young jailkid shrouded in mystery. Then
                  news came that <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#NC">Dean</a></span> was out of reform school and was coming to <span class="place" title="Place reference"><a href="places.html#NY">New York</a></span> for the first time; also there was talk that he had just married a girl called <span class="character" title="Character reference"><a href="characters.html#LAH">Marylou</a></span>.</p>
